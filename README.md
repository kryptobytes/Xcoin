Outline
=======

This is the code base for a web app that allows users to fill in a web form of simple parameters for a coin
which is then passed off to the server which runs Custom Coin Creation Service which outputs the source code
needed for a new cryptocurrency. 
This code would then be compiled in various environments and provided back to the web user who can then 
launch their coin.
